## Features
- **Anti-Aliasing:** Reduces the jagged edge effects to produce a smoother image. This works by sending multiple rays er pixel and averaging the ray colour.
- **Objects:** Supports the rendering of the following 3D objects:
  - Cylinder
  - Sphere
  - Plane
- **Lighting:** Supports the full phong reflection model to simulate the interaction of light with the surfaces. This creates a realistic depiction of shadows, reflections and diffusion.
- **Ambient Light:** Adds a constant indirect ambient light throughout the scene.
- **Camera:** Conditionally calculate a virtual viewport based on the camera's FOV (Field of view). This ensures images are rendered correctly.
- **Multi-Threading**: Utilizes multi-threading to improve rendering performance, enabling faster image rendering.
- **Documentation:** All functions have doxygen comments to ensure readability and to better understand the underlying logic at a glance.
